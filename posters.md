## Call for Posters

We are soliciting **1-2 page extended abstracts** targeting work involving robot hardware, especially encouraging presentation of "positive" and "negative" results (opportunities and challenges) that otherwise might have trouble finding a suitable venue. We hope this will be an opportunity to not just connect researchers working on hardware with each other, but also give them access to feedback from industry professionals. We are particularly interested in posters that discuss:
+ Critical software and hardware debugging experiences and insightful failed algorithmic and system level research attempts that are typically not “publishable”,
+ Aggregated “best practice” suggestions for getting up to speed on new robot hardware and for developing hardware and software infrastructures that enable rapid prototyping and easy deployments,
+ Surprising discoveries gleaned from deploying algorithms onto physical robots,
+ Work from early career students and professionals

### A Hybrid Poster Session

To support a hybrid poster session we will require all accepted posters to be submitted electronically along with a short (<3 minute) video describing the poster *before the start of the conference* so we can post them on our website for virtual attendees. We will then give each poster a designated time slot in which they will be supported by a virtual attendees coordinate to ensure that remote participants are able to fully interact with each poster.

### Submission Instructions

Abstracts should be submitted as **1-2 page** PDFs following the [standard RSS conference format](https://roboticsconference.org/information/authorinfo/) by **May 13, 2022 at 11:59PM AoE** to **TBD**.
